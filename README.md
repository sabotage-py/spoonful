# Spoonful
These are some of the code files for an internship I did with a startup during the summer of 2021.

The task was to train a model on the set of images of food packages to classify them as either `front-of-package`, `back-of-package`, or `misc`.

The code for training the model is in `train_model.ipynb`.

A subsequent task was to select the best representative among similar looking `front-of-package` images. Code for this task is in `helpers.py` and `stage2.py`.
